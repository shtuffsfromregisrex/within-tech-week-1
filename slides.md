# What is a Programming Language?
- A set of rules for instructing a computer
- Enables communication between humans and computers
- Examples: Python, JavaScript, Java, C++

---

---
# How Does a Computer Work?
- Basic Understanding of Hardware and Software
- CPU, Memory, Input/Output Devices
- Operating Systems and Application Software

---
# Control flows?
The computer flows <u>Sequential Execution </u>

Example:
```
1. Start
2. Input the first number (num1)
3. Input the second number (num2)
4. Add num1 and num2 and store the result in a variable sum
5. Output or display the sum
6. End

```
To add conditional execution we use control flows, they are:
- if 
- if else
- and more...
